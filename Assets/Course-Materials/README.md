Hello, I have created a google drive that will serve as a test. Ideally, this google drive will allow us to upload cirriculumn information in once place. Originally, I planned to upload the files directly to GitHub. Unfortunately, GitHub has a 25mb limit on uploads. Currently, I have the Genki 1 textbook and workbook as a test.
Here is the link:
